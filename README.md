Usage
-----

### User

Each participating user needs to add the bot as contact. Furthermore the bot needs to be added to a group.
For members in this group it is possible to assign tasks to other members if they have been detected by the bot.
To get detected, all users need to write an informal message in the group after the bot has been added.

Users can assign (/do \<task title\>), list (/tasks), show stats (/stats), etc. in the private chat with the bot.
Open task reminders are also shown in the private chat.
The bot posts status updates and weekly review messages to the group.

#### Supergroups

Following [actions](https://t.me/tgbetachat/59941) automatically cause groups to be converted to supergroups.
If that happens, it might be necessary to remove and add the bot again to those groups, and also to follow the setup (member detection) procedure as described above.


### Admin

The admin id is a Telegram user id and allows the specified user to perform following commands:

* admin-stats: Shows basic stats of the data in the database.
* admin-announce \<text\>: Sends \<text\> to all users.
* admin-feedback-show: Lists unresolved (not done) feedback entries.
* admin-feedback-reply \<id\> \<text\>: Sends \<text\> to the user that issued feedback \<id\>.
* admin-feedback-close \<id\>: Marks feedback \<id\> as done.
